## Overview
Aim of this plugin is to build a good Perl IDE using Perl, the plugin is divided into two parts:

* Vim API to intract with the Vim editor.
  * Uses Vim-Perl API, as described [here](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/if_perl.html).
  * NOTE : To run this plugin, your Vim should be compiled with Perl.
    * To test if your Vim was compile with Perl, run `vim --version`, if you find text `+perl` then you are good to go.
* Perl API to analyze the Perl code.
  * Using [PPI](https://metacpan.org/pod/PPI) module to parse the Perl code.

## Currently available features 
* `:GroupUse` : Group all use statement and put it after the 'package' statement if found, will have no impact if 'package' statement not found.
* `:GroupSortUse` : Group all use statement, sort them and put it after 'package' statement if found, will have no impact if 'package' statement not found.
* `:RemoveUnwantedNewLines` : Will replace a block of empty lines with single empty line.
* `:RemoveAllNewLines` : Will remove all the empty lines.
